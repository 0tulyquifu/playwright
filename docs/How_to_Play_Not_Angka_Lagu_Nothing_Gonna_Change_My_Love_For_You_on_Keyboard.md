For example, you can play the intro and the verse softly, then gradually increase the volume in the chorus and the bridge. You can also accentuate some notes or chords to emphasize them.
    Use articulation. Articulation is the way you play each note or chord, such as legato (smoothly connected), staccato (short and detached), or accent (stronger attack). You can use articulation to create different effects and moods in your playing. For example, you can play the melody legato to make it sound smooth and flowing, or staccato to make it sound crisp and lively.
    Use pedal. Pedal is a device that you press with your foot to sustain or cut off the sound. You can use pedal to create a richer and fuller sound, or to create a clear and clean sound. For example, you can use pedal to sustain the chords in the chorus and the bridge, or to cut off the chords in the verse.
    Use expression. Expression is the way you convey your feelings and emotions through your playing. You can use expression to make your playing more personal and meaningful. For example, you can play with more passion and intensity in the chorus, or with more tenderness and sweetness in the verse.
